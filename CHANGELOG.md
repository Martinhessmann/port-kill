  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Testing Required**: Visual appearance on different macOS versions, light/dark mode compatibility
- **macOS Application Bundle** - Professional .app bundle structure for `/Applications/` installation
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Testing Required**: Launch behavior, permissions, icon display in Finder/Dock

  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Testing Required**: Installation flow, code signing warnings, upgrade from previous versions
- **Enhanced Installation Script** - One-liner installation with automatic dependency handling
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Testing Required**: Fresh system installation, PATH configuration, cross-platform detection
- **Comprehensive Debug Tools** - `debug-portkill.sh` script with diagnostics and troubleshooting
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Testing Required**: Debug script functionality, log analysis accuracy
- **DEBUGGING.md** - Comprehensive debugging guide with common issues and solutions
- **Enhanced Logging** - Debug menu items and verbose console output when `RUST_LOG=debug`

### Changed
- **Icon System** - Migrated from generic icons to custom poison bottle design
- **Installation Process** - Added multiple installation methods (DMG, one-liner, manual)
- **Documentation** - Comprehensive guides for installation and debugging

### Fixed
- macOS crash issues with event loop handling
- Process detection reliability improvements
- **DMG Creation Issues** - Fixed volume unmounting problems and build script reliability
  - ‚úÖ **Resolved**: Force unmount functionality and Finder window cleanup
  - ‚úÖ **Resolved**: Auto-overwrite existing installations in /Applications/
- **Menu ID Mapping** - Partially fixed hardcoded mapping for common MenuIds

  - Crash occurs when menu tries to update after process count changes
  - Processes ARE killed successfully before crash
- **Tray Stability** - Icon may disappear or become unresponsive  
- **Console Mode Recommended** - More stable than tray mode for production use
